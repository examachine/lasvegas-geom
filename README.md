Ocaml implementation of randomized computational geometry algorithms from
the following important paper:

K. L. Clarkson and P. W. Shor. Applications of random sampling in
  computational geometry, II. Discrete Comput. Geom., 4:387--421, 1989.

  This paper from AT\&T labs introduces fast randomized algorithms for several
  problems including set of all intersecting pairs of line segments and convex
  hull computation. It is interesting as it draws from new mathematical
  results in study of random subsets in geometric algorithms
